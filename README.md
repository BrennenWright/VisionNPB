The REST Web API for the Ixia Vision Network Packet Broker (NPB), formerly the Net Tool Optimizer (NTO), provides a way for customers to programmatically modify the configuration of, or pull statistical information from, the Vision NPB.
 
This repository contains scripts written for the Vision NPBs.  We ambition that customers and Ixia engineers use this repository to find some scripts that they can reuse, or that they can use as examples to write new scripts.  We encourage the users of this repository to share their ideas, fixes, and new scripts.
